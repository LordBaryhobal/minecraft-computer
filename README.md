# Minecraft Redstone Computer

This repository contains a Minecraft world ([world.zip](world.zip)) of my redstone computer.

Minecraft version 1.15.2+, no mods required

The Fibonacci program described in [details.md](details.md) is already in the computer's memory. To run it simply press the button on the input panel in front of the spawn area.

A datapack is integrated to print in the chat the instructions sent by input panels and command blocks log the CPU's actions.

You can also find pictures in the [images](images) folder and details about how it is built and how it works in [details.md](details.md).

The instruction set and Fibonacci program presented in [details.md](details.md) are taken from the [Minecraft wiki article on redstone computers](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Redstone_computers).
